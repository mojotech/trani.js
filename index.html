                        <p><span class="time-span" data-time="0">I had my first heart attack in 2007, then my last heart attack was in 2011.</span>

<span class="time-span highlight" data-time="7">When you don't have nothing and your health is bad and you don't have nobody to turn to, and you've got to go somewhere</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="15">and they won't see you at the hospital, because you don't have insurance, I know what that is first hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="21">It's hard for a man of my age, sixty years old, to get a good job with any benefits or anything like that.</span>
 
<span class="time-span" data-time="31">I left a job making $42,000 a year to nothing.</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="33">I didn't have no money to pay for the hospital bills or nothing like that, so I had to file bankruptcy on them.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="40">The first hospital bill I paid myself, it cost me $10,000 out of my pocket.</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="45">But I didn't have a job, it took all my life savings I had, took everything I had.</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="52">You could say why didn't God save your home out there. I don't know why.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="56">But I know that I live for the Lord, and he said he'd take care of my needs and I needed a home, I needed insurance, but I didn't have any, he provided me a clinic to go to.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="71">We see anywhere from twenty-five to forty-nine, that's the most we've ever seen is forty-nine, and usually it averages out between twenty-five and thirty-five.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="86">So we are strictly for people who have no insurance whatsoever. And we have a lot of people like that in Gallia County. And they have to be Gallia County residents.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="99">I was so sick when I went there the first time, and I wanted to make sure I got there before the crowd,  so I went two hours early and set before they opened up.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="110"> How tall are you sir?</span></p> 

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="112">About six foot. How much now?</span></p> 

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="118">140, 198.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="123">The impression that I had was that all citizens here in the United States have access to medical care and basic health care.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="136">Much to my surprise there is a good percentage of the entire population of the United States are uninsured, which is, to me, very significant.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="149">Last night, I had fries, and a couple hot dogs, and big old pickles.</span></p> 

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="158">It is, how much, it is 283 the normal is 120.</span></p> 

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="166">Whoo! 160 more huh? Wow.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="170">What will happen is, if your sugar goes high, it will affect your kidney, it will affect your heart, and it will affect your eyes. Ok. Ok. And you have enough trouble. Alright. Right? Right.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="184">The medical community and the public health community have know for a long time that we have a huge segment of population in this -- let's say tri-state area,</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="189">which is the upper part of Appalachia -- that do not have medical care coverage.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="206">No type of insurance, either not offered or they cannot afford it. If it is offered it's astronomical and they can't afford it. It takes out of their take home pay so they just don't carry it.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="219">It's too high. They want $50 a week for the insurance on me, and they want $100 a week for my wife. That's $150 a week, with the salary I get, I make $500 a week.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="234">Take $150 off that, and I'm just doing nothing but working and paying insurance. By the time I pay all my other bills and things, you wouldn't have nothing; you wouldn't have no money for groceries.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="247">So I don't have no health insurance, I can't afford that. I don't make the greatest wages, but I'm making a wage for this area to sustain you. But you go out there and buy insurance, you can't afford it.</span></p>

<p><span class="time-span" data-time="263">Cardiac disease is rampant in this area. Smoking is right up there with it, and so you have problems with lung cancer, cardiac disease, stroke, hypertension,</span> 

<span class="time-span" data-time="281">and by the time we see them, they're up in their 50s, maybe 60s, and then you've got long term chronic problems that could have been taken care of and fixed years before that time.</span>

<span class="time-span" data-time="297">So when you look at it from a public health standpoint, we're failing miserably. We really are.</span></p>
